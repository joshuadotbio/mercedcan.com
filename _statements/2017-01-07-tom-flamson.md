I found the fact that the last time the Sheriff's Posse performed at a presidential inauguration was 2005 to be very telling. If they had a history of being genuinely non-partisan, it might have been worth debating. But given they are so clearly interested in only using County money to celebrate Republican victories, I see no reason the request should even be considered. It's blatantly political, and that is not something to spend public funds on.
