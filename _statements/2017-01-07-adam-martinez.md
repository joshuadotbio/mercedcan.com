I was driving around town today and noticed that we have very bad roads in Merced and they only get worse with the rain. Why not spend $10,000 on fixing areas of our roads where they need to be fixed? I know $10,000 might only put a dent on the amount of work that needs to be done, but why not make a start? In 5 years Merced could make great progress.
