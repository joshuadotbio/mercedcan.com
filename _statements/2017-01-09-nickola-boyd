Did the MERCED Sheriffs go to any of President Obama's inauguration parades? Is this something they do for all presidents or just Republican presidents? If not, this sends a very clear message of division to the people of MERCED County.  

I am a teacher in this county and have to spend out of pocket money weekly. Over my teaching career, I have spent thousands and thousands of dollars. In one year, I spent over $5,000.   I am told over and over, "We can't afford it." Obviously teaching and law enforcement money is different, but it is still taxpayer's money.  

There are many ways the MERCED Sheriffs could spend $10,000; scholarships to graduating seniors, homeless shelter, women's shelter, a drug treatment center, community out reach. Use the money to hold a community event to help improve relations with the local community. The list could go on and on.... 

Please vote for our county first! We do not have $10,000 to throw away....
