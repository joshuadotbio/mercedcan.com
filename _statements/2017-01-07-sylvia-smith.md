It's inappropriate to expend public funds to represent Merced County at such a bitterly controversial political event. We are Merced County, and we do not wish to have our name associated with President Elect Trump. Mr. Trump has stated that he intends to deport a community which has long been an anchor of our County's culture and economy; that he intends to strip vital health services for women by defunding Planned Parenthood; that he intends to discontinue health insurance for millions of people with no plan to replace that insurance; that he will likely seize the retirement and health care funds which seniors have paid into all of their lives to help close the gap which will be left by cutting taxes for our wealthiest citizens. Further, Vice-President Pence has been open about supporting electric shock conversion therapy for LGBTQ young people, and open about favoring the rollback of marriage rights for LGBTQ citizens. We believe that these intentions are not worthy of celebration, and therefore NO public funds should be expended to lend our names to the Inauguration celebration.
