My family and I have been the victims of the horrendous road conditions of Merced County. We had an accident that was solely cause by a county maintained road that had a pothole that caused my vehicle's tires to explode and sent me out of control until I crashed into objects near the road. My family has suffered over $30,000 in property damage and bodily injury. This does not include the psychological effects this accident has had on all members involved in the accident. Once again, the accident was SOLELY the result of the Merced County road conditions.  Merced County MUST be held accountable and fix their roads!  No person should ever suffer as we have. No one should ever lose their life. This responsibility is on the shoulders of the Board of Supervisors.

I understand that the funding for the proposed $10,000 the Sheriff is requesting from the Board of Supervisors for his horses and posse to attend President-elect's inauguration ceremony is coming from the county's advertising budget, not the road budget.  However, I would urge the county to use that $10,000 to advertise the improvements they plan to make and have made to the roads. Since my accident, I have met dozens of people who have commented on the horrendous road conditions of Merced County. This would better achieve the county's goal of using advertising funds to paint Merced County in a positive light.  

Additionally, based on research by the PEW Center, [38% of the public believe the President-elect will do either a poor or terrible job as President. 58% of the public have a very or mostly unfavorable view of the President-elect](http://www.people-press.org/2016/12/08/1-views-of-president-elect-trump-and-his-administration/). With such dismal numbers, why would Merced County see this as a logical, sound investment? In fact, the President-elect did not even win the popular vote in Merced County. He only won 40.39% of the vote - 12.08% less of the vote than his primary opposition. He is not popular in your county. He is not popular within the state of California. He is not popular within the Country.  So, please, explain how using advertising dollars that are meant to paint Merced County in a positive light to support a man who is so incredibly unpopular across the board meets the objective of your advertising funds? If the Board of Supervisors agrees to give Sheriff Warnke any funds for him or any members of his posse to attend the inauguration it will be blatantly about personal alliances and not about what's best for the County of Merced.
