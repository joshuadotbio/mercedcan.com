From a Merced community member,

The past presidential elections have stirred up strong emotions and set up a platform for such vitriol and hate against Muslims, undocumented people, women, LGBTQ folks and minorities that many community members, tax payers like myself do not feel represented by president-elect Trump. Just before the inauguration ceremony, learning that Merced, as one of the poorest counties in the nation, is prepared to fund with tax payers money, the strutting and parading of the sheriff’s posse in Washington, DC is a testament to the fact that our priorities are not in the right order. How are thousands of dollars allocated to the investiture of such a polarizing figure? Are there not any other pressing matters which could benefit from funds locally? How is sending the sheriff’s posse in Washington DC benefitting Merced’s local economy? Why are community members not informed of the decisions their public servants make on their behalf?

As a community member, having lived in Merced for the past 5 years, I vigorously reject:

The sheriff’s posse using tax payers money to celebrate president-elect trump, who in his rhetoric has insulted, demeaned and projects to strip from their rights, many of those tax payers.
