As a 27-year past resident of Merced County I feel that using tax money from our multicultural/multi-ethnic county tax base to perform at the 2017 inauguration is inappropriate. This has a threatening feel in light of how many people of many backgrounds make up and greatly contribute to the economy of Merced County and our state. Participation of local law enforcement implies special approval of a president with a well known and strong racist message and could lead to questions and unrest here as a result. Did the posse go to Obama's inauguration? Are there people of color in this posse? If they're all white then it awkwardly and incorrectly presents an image of racial exclusion in our county. If the posse includes people of color, then it compromises their dignity. Speaking for my family that continues to live in Merced and which now embraces the Hispanic culture through marriage and children, I object to this use of taxpayer money which is better spent for local county needs.
