Our right to privacy is under attack. Information revealed over the past two decades show clearly that multiple entities are engaged in mass surveillance of our communications and activities today. These entities include governments and international corporations.

Information security is a shared effort. Since it pertains to communication, it cannot be a one-sided commitment. It is our common duty as citizens not only to protect ourselves from unlawful mass surveillance, but also to protect our networks. Perhaps our most powerful tool for achieving this is encryption.

What follows are our recommendations for achieving secure, private, and encrypted communication, covering instant messaging, voice calling, email, video calling, and file sharing.

## Instant Messaging

Our recommended instant messaging application is WhatsApp. Although it was not known for its security features when it was first released in 2009, [WhatsApp has since implemented the Signal Protocol for encrypted communications developed by Open Whisper Systems](https://whispersystems.org/blog/whatsapp-complete/).
