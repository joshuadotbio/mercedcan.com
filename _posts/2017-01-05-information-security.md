Our right to privacy is under attack. Information revealed over the past two decades show clearly that both governments and international corporations are engaged in mass surveillance of our communications and activities today. This type of mass surveillance directly violates our right to privacy and indirectly threatens our rights to free expression and peaceful assembly. It is therefore our duty as citizens to wisely use the tools and methods available to us to protect our digital communications from unfair scrutiny by state and non-state actors.

Information security is a shared effort. Since it pertains to communication, it cannot be a one-sided commitment. Our common duty is not only to protect ourselves from unlawful mass surveillance, but also to protect the network. Our most powerful tool for achieving that is encryption.

What follows are our recommendations for achieving secure, private, and encrypted communication through instant messaging, voice calling, video calling, email, and file sharing. Since data is only as safe as the device where it is stored, we also have a recommendation for encrypting laptop and desktop hard drives. As further reading, we provide links to articles that discuss the relative merits of smartphone encryption on different brands and platforms.

## Instant Messaging

Our top recommendation for an instant messaging application is [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/download/). Although it was not known for its security features when it was first released in 2009, [WhatsApp has since implemented the Signal Protocol for encrypted communications developed by Open Whisper Systems](https://whispersystems.org/blog/whatsapp-complete/). Using this protocol, messages are encrypted before they leave your device, so that only encrypted data is stored in WhatsApp's servers. This makes WhatsApp one of the most secure messaging platforms available. That level of security, plus the fact that WhatsApp is used by more than 1 billion people worldwide makes it an easy choice.

Our second recommendation for secure messaging is the [Signal app](https://whispersystems.org/). Signal is arguably the most secure messaging platform available. It is open source, and is developed and operated by Open Whisper Systems, the independent company that created the namesake Signal Protocol, the same protocol that makes WhatsApp secure. However, Signal lags far behind WhatsApp in its adoption rate. It is because of Signal's low adoption rates that we recommend WhatsApp over Signal. However, if your personal security requirements are unusually high, you might consider Signal your first choice.

## Voice Calling

WhatsApp and Signal both provide encrypted voice calling with the same level of security that they provide for their instant messaging features. Therefore, our recommendations for voice calling are the same as with instant messaging.

## Video Calling

WhatsApp provides encrypted video calling, but Signal does not. Currently, [WhatsApp is our only recommendation for secure video calling](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/11/16/whatsapp-tightens-user-privacy-with-encrypted-video-calls/).
