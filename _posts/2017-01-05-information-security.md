Our right to privacy is under attack. Information revealed over the past two decades show clearly that multiple entities are engaged in mass surveillance of our communications and activities today. These entities include governments and international corporations.

Information security is a shared effort. Since it pertains to communication, it cannot be a one-sided commitment. It is our common duty as citizens not only to protect ourselves from unlawful mass surveillance, but also to protect our networks. Perhaps our most powerful tool for achieving this is encryption.

What follows are our recommendations for achieving secure, private, and encrypted communication, covering instant messaging, voice calling, video calling, email, and file sharing. Since data is only as safe as the device where it is stored, we also have a recommendation for encrypting laptop and desktop hard drives.

## Instant Messaging

Our top recommendation for an instant messaging application is [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/download/). Although it was not known for its security features when it was first released in 2009, [WhatsApp has since implemented the Signal Protocol for encrypted communications developed by Open Whisper Systems](https://whispersystems.org/blog/whatsapp-complete/). Using this protocol, messages are encrypted before they leave your device, so that only encrypted data is stored in WhatsApp's servers. This makes WhatsApp one of the most secure messaging platforms available. That level of security, plus the fact that WhatsApp is used by more than 1 billion people worldwide makes it an easy choice.

Our second recommendation for secure messaging is the Signal app. Signal is arguably the most secure messaging platform available. It is open source, and it is developed and operated by Open Whisper Systems, the independent company that created the namesake Signal Protocol, the same protocol that makes WhatsApp secure. However, Signal lags far behind WhatsApp in its adoption rate. It is due Signal's low adoption rates that we recommend WhatsApp over Signal.

## Voice Calling

WhatsApp and Signal both provide encrypted voice calling with the same level of security that they provide for their instant messaging features. Therefore, our recommendations for voice calling are the same as with instant messaging.

## Video Calling

WhatsApp provides encrypted video calling, but Signal does not. Currently, WhatsApp is our only recommendation for secure video calling.
