In response to overwhelming community interest, MercedCAN presents a workshop series entitled “Agitate, Educate, Organize”. On Thursday the 15th, please join us for a workshop on Immigration, Sanctuary Policy, and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, presented by Jennifer Morales and Joshua Gonzales.
<br>
<br>Many organizations in Merced have been deeply involved in supporting immigrant rights for years. If you want to become an ally and join the effort to protect the undocumented people in our community, this workshop will get you started. If you're already involved in the effort, this is a chance to connect with like-minded people.
<br>
<br>There will be free food and an opportunity to meet your neighbors.
<br>
<br>Hope to see you there!
